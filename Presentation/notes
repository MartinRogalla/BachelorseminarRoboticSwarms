Introduction: what, why how
what: what are swarm robotics, we want to provide a survey of problems and solutions faced in this research area
why: Addressing these problems and their approaches gives a better overview and offers inspiration to solve other problems.
how: Mention for each problem some real-life application, then provide some solutions in the form of different algorithms and compare these solutions
Many articles already exist which give an overview of applications and used practices in this area, but
often do not explain the problems underlying these practices. Therefore, we focus on providing a problemoriented
overview of the robotic swarms, while also providing a general overview of best practices and
solutions of these problems.

Terminology
Swarm definition, an exception is of course when a swarm of multiple robots is
controlled by one control station.
Problem definition: composite or main problem
Location type and information type
Scalability and performance
Problem composition overview: explain the order of problems

Formation
Discuss it first because of many subproblem of other problems
Applications: Transport, area surveillance
subproblems: communication and formation stability
Algorithm: leader-follower, behavior-based, virtual structure and some advanced algorithms
