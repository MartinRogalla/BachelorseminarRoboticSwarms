\section{Introduction}
  In order to emphasize the importance of the connection between the technology and its applications, a top-down approach is used for this survey. For each of the applications, an analysis is made of all the required services.
  
  	Robotic swarms can be used for many real-world applications as for example in tasks that cover a region, tasks that are to dangerous for human beings, tasks that scale-up or scale-down in time or tasks that require redundancy \cite{csahin2005swarm}.

  \subsubsection{Swarm-Assisted Fire Fighting}
  \textbf{Description: }\emph{Swarm-Assisted Fire Fighting makes interactive use of autonomous robots in fire emergency settings. These swarms of robots are capable of supporting and enhancing fire fighting operations co-operatively with each other and are coordinated by a single human supervisor.}\cite{Naghsh2008,Penders2011}\\\\
  The services required for swarm-assisted fire fighting include, but are not limited to: foraging, dispersion, mapping and exploration.\cite{Naghsh2008,Penders2011} The foraging services are needed in order to give the swarm the ability to search and locate victims. Dispersion is required in order for the swarm to navigate optimally and have non-conflicting exploration. The mapping and exploration service are required to create a well constructed map of the explored area, such that the human and other robots are aware of their surroundings, even if it is impossible to get a visual due to reduced visibility caused by smoke.
