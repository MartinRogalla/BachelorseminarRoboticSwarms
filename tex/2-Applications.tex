Robotic swarms can be used for many real-world applications as for example in tasks that cover a region, tasks that are to dangerous for human beings, tasks that scale-up or scale-down in time or tasks that require redundancy \cite{csahin2005swarm}. In this chapter, we will name a few of the most-used techniques used by actual applications of robotic swarms, and give examples of applications that use these techniques.

  \subsection{Overview}
  Give an overview of real-world applications possible with Robotic Swarms. A list of possible applications:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Area Cleaning
      \item Space Exploration (swarm of Mars rovers)
      \item Rescue Missions
      \item Treacherous Radioactive Survey
      \item Survey and cleanup of Toxic Spills
      \item Surveillance
      \item Swarm-Assisted Fire Fighting
     \item Collective Transport of Complex Objects
    \end{enumerate}
  \textbf{Categories}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Region Covering
      \item Dangers
      \item Scaling in time
