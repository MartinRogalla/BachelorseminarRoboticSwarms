Robotic swarms can be used for many real-world applications as for example in tasks that cover a region, tasks that are to dangerous for human beings, tasks that scale-up or scale-down in time or tasks that require redundancy \cite{csahin2005swarm}. In this chapter, we will name a few of the most-used techniques used by actual applications of robotic swarms, and give examples of applications that use these techniques.
