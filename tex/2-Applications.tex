Robotic swarms can be used for many real-world applications which can be roughly split up in tasks that cover a region, tasks that are to dangerous for human beings, tasks that scale-up or scale-down in time or tasks that require redundancy \cite{csahin2005swarm}. In this chapter, for every technique the scope of the technique is defined and a few examples of practical applications will be named. We should mention that we chose a selection of techniques that we think are mostly used in the applications we have looked at. Some of these techniques partly overlap and/or make use of each other, but it is essential to compare them independently to identify the current problems and already found solutions in swarm robotics.
