Robotic swarms can be used for many real-world applications as for example in tasks that cover a region, tasks that are to dangerous for human beings, tasks that scale-up or scale-down in time or tasks that require redundancy \cite{csahin2005swarm}.

  \subsection{Spot Exploration}
  \textbf{Description: }\emph{Cleaning/exploring a component in an unkown area is a common problem which can be solved effectively by using a tobotic swarm. For example in \cite{wagner2008cooperative} a swarm of robots is placed in a certain component which has to be cleaned totally. The robots have limited visibility and can only see other robots within a certain distance. Main goal is to not disconnect the component that has to be cleaned to be sure that the component will be get fully cleaned in the end.} \\
  The main techniques that are described in \cite{wagner2008cooperative} are algorithms that preserve the connectivity of the spot to be cleaned and prevent the clustering of robots.
  
  \subsection{Area Exploration}
  \textbf{Description: }\emph{Exploration of an unkown environment can be done conveniently using robotic swarms. This can be very useful in cases of hazardous environments. In \cite{sheng2006distributed} a model is described in which the robots have limited communication range and full knowledge of their location. By continuously looking for the closest undiscovered area in combination with a nearness measure it tends to explore the complete area by staying together and continiously updating each others maps.} 
  
  Some of the techniques used are communication, exploration, dispersion, mapping. \cite{sheng2006distributed}
  
  \subsection{Swarm-Assisted Fire Fighting}
  \textbf{Description: }\emph{Swarm-Assisted Fire Fighting makes interactive use of autonomous robots in fire emergency settings. These swarms of robots are capable of supporting and enhancing fire fighting operations co-operatively with each other and are coordinated by a single human supervisor.}\cite{Naghsh2008,Penders2011}\\

  The techniques required for Swarm-Assisted Fire Fighting include, but are not limited to: \emph{foraging}, \emph{formation}, \emph{mapping} and \emph{exploration}.\cite{Naghsh2008,Penders2011}\todo[inline]{Check more sources and verify techniques} The foraging techniques are needed in order to give the swarm the ability to search and locate victims. Formation is required in order for the swarm to navigate optimally and prevent conflicts in exploration. The mapping and exploration service are required to create a well constructed map of the explored area, such that the human and other robots are aware of their surroundings, even if it is impossible to get a visual due to reduced visibility caused by smoke.

  \subsection{Toxic Emition Source Discovery by Robotic-Swarms}
  \textbf{Description: }\emph{Due to the ambiguity of this name, there have been many applications which have aimed to achieve this, from nuclear spills and oil spills to fire-origins. Much of this however is theoretical work, due to the fact that the price of these individual robots is still rather high.}

  Some of the techniques used in toxic source discovery are: control, communication and distribution.\cite{Li2012}
