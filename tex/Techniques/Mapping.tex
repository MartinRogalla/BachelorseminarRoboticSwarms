Mapping is a technique which is used for many applications and is incorporated in other techniques. Exploration is one of the techniques, which rely on mapping. The goal of mapping is to make a rough overview of the surrounding unknown environment. In this section we will focus on collaborative mapping algorithms for usage with robotic swarms.
