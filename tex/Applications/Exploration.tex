\textbf{Description: }
  \emph{Exploring an unknown environment is a common problem which can be solved effectively with the usage of robotic swarm. For example in \cite{wagner2008cooperative} a swarm of robots is placed in a certain environment which has to be completely cleaned. The robots have limited visibility and and can only communicated with other robots within a limited range. The main goal is to keep connectivity of the areas to be cleaned in order to guarantee that the environment will be get fully cleaned in the end.}\\
  The main techniques that are described in \cite{wagner2008cooperative} are algorithms that preserve the connectivity of the area to be cleaned and prevent the clustering of robots.
