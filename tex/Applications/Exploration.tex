Exploring an environment is one of the fundamental problems faced in mobile robotics. The main goal is to minimize the overall exploration time and the main problem faced when trying to achieve this goal is finding appropriate target points for each individual robot so that they simultaneously explore different regions of the area \cite{burgard2005coordinated}. Robotic swarm exploration can be used for real-world applications like rescue missions \cite{Naghsh2008,Penders2011}, surveillance \cite{Burkle2010} and cleaning \cite{wagner2008cooperative}.
