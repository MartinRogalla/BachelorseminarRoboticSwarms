  \emph{Swarm-Assisted Exploration makes interactive use of autonomous robots in exploration settings. The swarms of robots are capable of supporting and enhancing operations co-operatively with each other and are coordinated by a single human supervisor.}\cite{Naghsh2008,Penders2011}
    The techniques required for Swarm-Assisted Exploration include, but are not limited to: \emph{foraging}, \emph{formation}, \emph{mapping} and \emph{exploration}.\cite{Naghsh2008,Penders2011} The foraging techniques are needed in order to give the swarm the ability to search and locate subjects. Formation is required in order for the swarm to navigate optimally and prevent conflicts in exploration. The mapping and exploration service are required to create a well constructed map of the explored area, such that the human and other robots are aware of their surroundings, even if it is impossible to get a visual due to reduced visibility.
