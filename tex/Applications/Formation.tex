  \subsection{Exploration}
  \textbf{Description: }\emph{Cleaning/exploring a component in an unkown area is a common problem which can be solved effectively by using a tobotic swarm. For example in \cite{wagner2008cooperative} a swarm of robots is placed in a certain component which has to be cleaned totally. The robots have limited visibility and can only see other robots within a certain distance. Main goal is to not disconnect the component that has to be cleaned to be sure that the component will be get fully cleaned in the end.} \\
  The main techniques that are described in \cite{wagner2008cooperative} are algorithms that preserve the connectivity of the spot to be cleaned and prevent the clustering of robots.
