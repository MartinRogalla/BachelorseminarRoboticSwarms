  \emph{Source localization is used in a large category of robotic-swarm applications. Some of the topics include, but are not limited to: chemical plume tracing\cite{zarzhitsky2005distributed}, radiation source search\cite{bashyal2008human}, fire searching\cite{marjovi2009multi} and other types of emission source localization\cite{cui2004swarm}. A large amount of the work done in this field is purely theoretical, this is due to the fact that the price of these individual robots is still rather high and thus it is expensive to produce a large quantity.}

  The main techniques underlying these applications include: control, communication, path-planning and distribution.\cite{Li2012}
