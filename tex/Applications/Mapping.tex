\emph{The mapping of an unkown environment can be conveniently done with the usage of robotic swarms, this is called collaborative mapping. Collaborative mapping is very useful in hazourous and unaccessable environments.\cite{hardin2004modified} In \cite{sheng2006distributed} a model is described in which the robots have limited communication range and full knowledge of their location. By continuously looking for the closest undiscovered area in combination with a nearest measure it tends to explore the complete area by staying together and continiously updating each others maps.}
Some of the techniques used in these types of applications are localization, exploration, dispersion, mapping. \cite{sheng2006distributed,rothermich2005distributed}
