\textbf{Description: }\emph{Exploration of an unkown environment can be done conveniently using robotic swarms. This can be very useful in cases of hazardous environments. In \cite{sheng2006distributed} a model is described in which the robots have limited communication range and full knowledge of their location. By continuously looking for the closest undiscovered area in combination with a nearness measure it tends to explore the complete area by staying together and continiously updating each others maps.}
 Some of the techniques used are communication, exploration, dispersion, mapping. \cite{sheng2006distributed}
