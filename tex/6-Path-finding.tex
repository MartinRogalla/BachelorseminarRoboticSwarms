  Path finding or path planning (in this paper we will use path finding) basically is the basis of every robotic swarm technique, since every distributed algorithm in mobile robotics tries to find the best location to go to from its current location. In this paper we consider path finding as the problem to find the optimal collision free path from the start state to the goal state. \cite{qin2004path}. Path finding can be used in multiple real-life applications such as foraging (trying to find food sources and bring food back to the basis) \cite{hoff2010two} and searching (for spills, victims, targets) \cite{pugh2007inspiring} and is often combined with some form of particle swarm optimization \cite{poli2007particle}.
