Formation is the problem of controlling the relative position and orientation of the robots in a group while allowing the group to move as a whole. \cite{consolini}
The formation problem is an important part in applications, as it is used in virtually every other problem. 
In particular in the collective transport problem, where a swarm has to hold a formation to move an object. 
An application in which formation is extensively used is surveillance, because when an area has to be monitored, formation is used to increase coverage. \cite{burkle2011} \\

Over the years, many different algorithms have been used to solve the formation problem. \cite{chen2005}
These algorithms became more advanced as the field of robotics became more advanced, but the older algorithms can be categorized as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item leader-follower strategy \cite{consoline2007}
	\item visual structure approach \cite{ren}
	\item Behavior-based method \cite{balch1998}
\end{itemize}

These algorithms are expanded upon in later algorithms, of which a few are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item virtual space configuration \cite{Wee}
	\item vision-based framework \cite{Das}
	\item fuzzy formation control \cite{Ranjbar-Sahraei}
	\item team-work software control \cite{Kaminka}
\end{itemize}

Two main problems can be extracted from the original formation problem: communication and stability. 
Each swarm has to have some form of communication to keep track of the relative distance between each robot. 
The algorithms differ in ways of communication, as one algorithm only relies on local communication and the other works with a central framework.
Some algorithms keep track of each robot's location and are thus location-based, while others are location-free. \\

Another prevalentproblem that these algorithms need to deal with is how to provide a stable formation. 
Specifically, how to dampen the effects of disturbance propagation when travelling from the source robot to the other robots. 
For each algorithm, we will review how these problems are solved.
