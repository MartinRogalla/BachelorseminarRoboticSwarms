After pointing out some applications implementing important techniques used in robotic swarms, we will now provide an in-depth study for these techniques. For every technique, we will make comparisons between different algorithms used by a technique, the problems that are solved and the the problems that are yet to be solved. This chapter thus serves to provide a good overview of ways to implement a technique.
