Introduction: what, why how
what: what are swarm robotics, we want to provide a survey of problems and solutions faced in this research area
why: Addressing these problems and their approaches gives a better overview and offers inspiration to solve other problems.
how: Mention for each problem some real-life application, then provide some solutions in the form of different algorithms and compare these solutions
Many articles already exist which give an overview of applications and used practices in this area, but
often do not explain the problems underlying these practices. Therefore, we focus on providing a problemoriented
overview of the robotic swarms, while also providing a general overview of best practices and
solutions of these problems.

Terminology
Swarm definition, an exception is of course when a swarm of multiple robots is
controlled by one control station.
Problem definition: composite or main problem
Location type and information type
Scalability and performance
Problem composition overview: explain the order of problems

Formation
Formation is the problem of controlling the relative position and orientation of the robots in a group
while allowing the group to move as a whole.
Discuss it first because of many subproblem of other problems
Applications: Transport, area surveillance
subproblems: communication and formation stability
Centralized communication more stability, but less scalable

Dispersion:
Dispersion can be compared to the blanket coverage problem, how to cover as much space as possible
Applications disaster response, fast communication network initialization
Problems are fluctuation in relative position data, and deadzones in ranges

Exploration
Another fundamental problem in swarm robotics is the task to fully explore an unknown environment.
Applications: Rescue missions, assist navigation firefighters
Problems: Keeping track of map and sharing it, making use ad-hoc networks

Source localization:
The main solution is to design an algorithm that effectively allows a swarm of
robots to explore an unknown area and end (multiple) source(s).
