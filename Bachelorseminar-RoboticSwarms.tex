\begin{abstract}
Swarm robotics has become a prominent and promising research area in the recent years. 
It has great potential use for a large variety of applications. 
In order to not forget the big picture, we believe that a survey of a few basic problems in this field should be given. 
This survey presents a concise overview of a few problems that the robotic swarms research area has faced. For each problem we provide a small discussion as to which approaches were chosen. 
Finally we mention the remaining issues for each problem. 
Each of the algorithms can be categorized by their usage of range information and location information. 
We show the problems which come with each of these categories and compare the scalability and performance of each approach. 
This provides insight into the properties of the algorithms which affect the scalability and the performance. 
Addressing these problems and their approaches gives a better overview and offers inspiration to solve other problems.
Finally we give a general conclusion regarding the recent advancements in robotic swarms.
